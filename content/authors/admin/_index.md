Hi! I am Dvij Kalaria, a first-year EECS PhD student at UC Berkeley affiliated with [Berkeley AI Research](https://bair.berkeley.edu/) (BAIR) advised by [Prof. Shankar Sastry](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Faculty/Homepages/sastry.html). 

Previously I was a MS Robotics student at CMU [LeCAR](https://lecar-lab.github.io/) lab and [DRIVE](https://drive-lab-cmu.github.io/) lab, working with Professor [Guanya Shi](https://www.gshi.me/) and [John M. Dolan](https://www.ri.cmu.edu/ri-faculty/john-m-dolan/). For my undergraduate thesis, I was co-advised by Prof. [Partha Pratim Chakrabarti](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~ppchak/index.html) and Prof. [Aritra Hazra](https://cse.iitkgp.ac.in/~aritrah/)

Broadly, I am interested in Agile robots ü¶æ ü¶ø üèéÔ∏è that operate at their limits and can rapidly adapt to unknown scenarios. Currently, I am focused on marying game theory with real-time robots such that they can play sports like table tennis, and can collaborate with humans in whole body tasks like lifting and moving around heavy objects. 

From 2022 to 2024 I led vehicle dynamics team of [AI Racing Tech](https://www.airacingtech.com/) üèéÔ∏è, a multi-million $ autonomous racing research project in UCB, CMU and UCSD. I deployed real-world robot learning on F1-level self-driving race cars at 160 MPH. We are the top U.S. team in the [Indy Autonomous Challenge](https://www.indyautonomouschallenge.com/).
