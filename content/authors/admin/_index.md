Hi! I am Dvij Kalaria, a final-year Masters of Science in Robotics (MSR) student at the Robotics Institute, Carnegie Mellon University advised by Dr. John Dolan and Dr. Qin Lin. I am interested in Agile robots, Embodied AI, Reinforcement Learning (RL), Adaptive control, Computer Vision especially in the domain of mobile robots. Currently, I am working on using RL for offroad driving on uneven terrain on a custom-built simulator. Apart from this, I am an active part as the vehicle dynamics lead of AIRacingTech for Indy Autonomous Challenge (IAC).
